    The café's décor is a tasteful blend of comfort and simplicity, featuring clean lines and a neutral color palette that exudes calm. Soft cushions and bean bags are scattered throughout, inviting you to sink in and unwind. Each seating area offers a clear view of playful kittens and lounging cats, all waiting for a friendly stroke or a playful interaction.
    Large windows allow natural light to fill the space, creating a bright and airy feel. Potted plants add a touch of greenery, purifying the air and bringing a bit of nature indoors. The scent of freshly brewed coffee and homemade treats drifts from the counter, promising delicious delights for you and tasty tidbits for the cats.
    At Yanapa Mishi the pace is slow, the atmosphere is soothing, and the company is simply purr-fect. It's an ideal retreat from the hustle and bustle of daily life, where you can enjoy the company of feline friends and leave feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.
